 1. #Matrix Addition#
    This project performs element-wise addition of two 3x3 matrices and stores the result in a third matrix.
 2. #Matrix Transposition#
    This project creates the transpose of a 3x3 matrix by switching rows and columns.
 3. #Row-wise Product of Matrix Elements#
    This project calculates the product of each row's elements in a 3x3 matrix and stores them in a separate array.
 4. #Diagonal Product of Two Matrices#
    This project calculates and prints the product of the diagonal elements (main diagonal) for two separate 3x3 matrices.
 5. #Sorting Rows and Columns#
    This project applies a sorting algorithm (selection sort) to sort both the columns and rows of a 3x3 matrix in descending order.
